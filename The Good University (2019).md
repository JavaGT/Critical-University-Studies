# Introduction
Book inspired by a 2013 management proposal for a [[real wage cut]] and removal of [[academic freedom]]. Strikes occurred.

Striking & negotiating techniques included videos, open letters, union balloons, satirical yoga.

We need bolder agendas for the institutions we should be building.

Other books: [[The University in Ruins]], [[The University in Crisis]],
[[The Fall of the Faculty]]

Governments are squeezing university funding

Distrust between university workers and management

Distrust between students and staff [[Rhodes Must Fall]]

United Nations Data on people attending university

[[Simon Marginson]] – Political economy of universities

Pay of university presidents, vice-chancellors, and rectors make a lot of money (often >$1m a year)

## [[Define University]]
"it is any institution with the legal power to grant degrees, or equivalent qualifications – bachelor’s and master’s degrees, doctorates and licenciates."

## [[kinds of university]] – [[G. D. Sharma]]
"the different kinds of universities that are found in India today."
* national and state-level public universities;
* for-profit private universities; 
* unitary vs affiliating universities; 
* residential vs non-residential universities; 
* specialized universities in different parts of the country for agriculture, engineering, medicine and law; 
* universities based on indigenous knowledges;
* open universities;
* management and technology institutes, some of which are ‘deemed-to-be universities’ (an official term) and are entitled to grant degrees.

"There is no deep purple essence of a university, able to be celebrated or betrayed. However there is a great deal of overlap in what different universities and their workers actually do; and that common ground is the subject-matter of this book."

## History of the [[purpose of university]]
Teaching and research combination is historically recent.

### Teaching the classics only
"[[John Henry Newman]]’s [[The Idea of a University]], argued that a good university should do no research at all! Its proper job was to broaden the minds of young gentlemen by exposing them to the classics."

### Professional Education
"In republican and Napoleonic France, specialized centres of professional education were created, entered only by rigorous examination. They included the famous École polytechnique and the École normale supérieure.""

### Intellectual enquiry
* Hannover and Prussia, the Universities of Göttingen and Berlin
* intellectual enquiry and  professor/student collaboration
* Universities wrestle with unknown problems, rather than repeat  knowledge

### Distance Education
#to-revisit
"In England, the University of London was set up to affiliate existing colleges through an examination system. This allowed expansion more easily than the single-campus unitary model. By the simple move of allowing outside students to sit for the exams, a mechanism for distance education was born. The University of London became the centre of an astonishing spiderweb of study centres; by the 1940s it had more than 50 overseas centres. Distance education fed into the television-and-radio work of Open Universities. They in turn led to the MOOCs (massive open online courses) of the twenty-first century.9"

## Contemporary
Today, most universities teach more than research.

The connection between learning and research is to create following generations of researchers, "So the Göttingen/Berlin ideal of a synthesis of research and teaching survived."

The growth of universities has also grown their toxicities, success and crisis are deeply linked.

Universities are a social asset, produced by workers and students 

Universities are miswielded, creating atomic weapons, excluding minority groups; women, colonised peoples, working classes, etc.

Universities are increasingly under the control of business elites

University education grants access to networks and social privilege

Seeking advantage via education undermines democratic values.

## Recognising research and teaching as work
1. we need to explore how labour organises knowledge
2. need to understand teaching and learning at advanced levels
3. must consider their workforce's cooperation and effectiveness

Creating good universities requires a broad agenda of democratic change.

Universities are socially conformist


# Chapter 1 – Making the knowledge: Research

Labour produces knowledge, research generates truth
- [[University prestige]] is linked to researchers' work.
- [[The World Bank]]: we are living in/constructing [[knowledge society]]
- Everyday practise generally does not use cutting edge research
- [[Armand Mattelart]] & [[Mats Alvesson]] discuss the marketing of [[information society]] and [[knowledge society]] as largely marketing/hype/rhetoric

## [[modern research]]
made with the combined efforts of a whole workforce.
Research is a social process.
Research produces *research based knowledge formation* [[research based knowledge]]
We live in a [[post-truth]] era, where does research fit?
"Every grant proposal is an exercise in speculative fiction that closes its eyes to the chaos that is sure to arrive" [[grantsmanship]]
[[research funding]] varies drastically by location
[[research funders]] have different expectations for practicality, immediacy, and scale.

## Researchers
[[researchers]] are people, that exist in spaces, with bodies, emotions, and relationships. Their time is taken up in workplaces of varying qualities, increasingly frequently with computers. They are in [[insecure emplyment]]. They are graduate students, grant-funded research assistants, out-sourced technical workers, fixed term research fellows and untenured academics.

**Why be a researcher?**
Belief that work is intrinsically important.
Commitment to [[knowledge commons]]
Passion maintains long work hours despite insecurity.
Fascination – although we cannot admit it in research articles, see: [[Nicholas Harberd]] in [[Seed to Seed (to date)]]
Deep satisfaction from making a pathway through a researchable space.
Research work is founded in the collaboration of a global workforce. 
[[research communities]] provide friendship, mentoring, [[research collaboration]], advice, and assistance.
[[Geoff Sharp]] identified that researchers require autonomy and are horizontally connected. Cooperative rather than commanded.
81 per cent agreed, "most people in my workplace treat each other as equals"

[[global academic hierarchies]]
Global hierarchies elevate Europe and North America academia, researchers in the global south are relegated to poor research jobs.

The formation of [[research based knowledge]] is upon the unequal and politically unstable world economy with no security. 

[[Karl Pearson]] a founder of modern statistics (later crank eugenicist), laid out an empiricist vision:
Scientific method is orderly classification of facts, recognising relationships and reoccurring sequences between them. [[empiricism]] [[scientific method]]
- Emphasises facts and data
- OTHERS (1920 Vienna Circle Philosophers): emphasise hypothesis, laws, verification, falsification

[[Karl Popper]] [[The Logic of Research (1934)]]
The logic of research separates science from religion, magic, metaphysics, and opinion.

[[Paul Feyerabend]] A rationalist model of science is dangerous, leading to epistemological anarchism, anything goes

## Researching
[[knowledge production]]
The making of knowledge is a large global industry, combining various type of work and workers.
Knowledge work transforms an existing state of knowledge into a new state. Thus the [[literature review]] helps understand the current state for optimal transformation. STEP NAME:[[archive work]] [[scholarship]]
The archive also contains within [[research skills]] from earlier work, accumulated knowledge on *how* to do X and discover Y.

Any [[research plan]] must consider from where it comes, and where it is going, what knowledge it hopes to make.

[[research]]
"Discovering things"
Comes in many forms, it is the STEP NAME:[[encounter]] of data, collecting information, reading manuscripts, travelling to site. Data is often collected by junior team members, or even automated, such as atmospheric measurements.[[automated data collection]]

[[humanities research]] is about interpretation of materials.

[[Andrew Pickering]]'s [[The Mangle of Practice]] examines the development of machines in the physical sciences that are fundamentally managed by researchers.

STEP NAME:[[patterning]] is interpreting, developing models and theories which explain the patterns we observe in the materials. Intuition and deductive thought are also necessary beyond cataloguing. Demands familiarity with the materials.
Boldness is a virtue here.

Mathematical patterning carries a lot of prestige, applied from weather models for example.
The clinical prose of APA DSM-5 categorises patients, history studies convey patterns in books of prose.

Patterning describes the material separate from its encounter, linking cases and encounters together.

Patterns define the limits of our knowledge also, excess data which is unintelligible reveals our ignorance.

STEP NAME: [[critique]]
Honesty is a virtue here
A collective modesty, all findings, theories are provisional.

STEP NAME: [[broadcasting]]
Even solo research is a social process. [[research is social]]
must be communicated to create the archive of knowledge.

- Conference papers
- books
- reports
- journal articles

[[research journals]] began as the printed minutes of early scientific societies and letters from researchers
They are standardised now, but other incarnations exist, such as dialogues.

Broadcasting happens beyond the academe, to professionals and publics.

The internet has created new genres, such as blog posts and data banks.

[[writing]] is skilled labour.
- Many academics write poorly due to pressure to produce more research.

Research involves 5 types of labour: using the archive, encountering materials, patterning, critiquing, and broadcasting. They are all interwoven in daily practise.

## The knowledge formation
[[knowledge production]] is complex, formalised via a [[knowledge formation]] (body of concepts, methods, norms, genres etc.)
There are many knowledge formations today, [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[The Idea of a University]] was bad because it used an outdated knowledge formation dependent on religion and ancient texts.

[[Auguste Comte]] looked forward and created [[Comte's Map of Knowledge]] in the 1830s, which influences universities organisation today. [[Cours de philosophie positive]] named five 'positive' sciences. Comte places the social sciences in the same basket as inorganic nature.
All of which rested upon mathematics, creating 6 domains of knowledge, and associated curriculum.

[[research based knowledge]] and the [[research university]] formed together off the back of this new schema.

Science and [[research based knowledge]] may still be replaced by another not yet imagined form of knowledge [[James Frazer]] [[The Golden Bough (to date)]]
