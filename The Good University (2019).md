## [[Define University]]
"it is any institution with the legal power to grant degrees, or equivalent qualifications – bachelor’s and master’s degrees, doctorates and licenciates."

## [[kinds of university]] – [[G. D. Sharma]]
"the different kinds of universities that are found in India today."
* national and state-level public universities;
* for-profit private universities; 
* unitary vs affiliating universities; 
* residential vs non-residential universities; 
* specialized universities in different parts of the country for agriculture, engineering, medicine and law; 
* universities based on indigenous knowledges;
* open universities;
* management and technology institutes, some of which are ‘deemed-to-be universities’ (an official term) and are entitled to grant degrees.

"There is no deep purple essence of a university, able to be celebrated or betrayed. However there is a great deal of overlap in what different universities and their workers actually do; and that common ground is the subject-matter of this book."

## History of the [[purpose of university]]
Teaching and research combination is historically recent.

### Teaching the classics only
"[[John Henry Newman]]’s [[The Idea of a University]], argued that a good university should do no research at all! Its proper job was to broaden the minds of young gentlemen by exposing them to the classics."

### Professional Education
"In republican and Napoleonic France, specialized centres of professional education were created, entered only by rigorous examination. They included the famous École polytechnique and the École normale supérieure.""

### Intellectual enquiry
* Hannover and Prussia, the Universities of Göttingen and Berlin
* intellectual enquiry and  professor/student collaboration
* Universities wrestle with unknown problems, rather than repeat  knowledge

### Distance Education
#to-revisit
"In England, the University of London was set up to affiliate existing colleges through an examination system. This allowed expansion more easily than the single-campus unitary model. By the simple move of allowing outside students to sit for the exams, a mechanism for distance education was born. The University of London became the centre of an astonishing spiderweb of study centres; by the 1940s it had more than 50 overseas centres. Distance education fed into the television-and-radio work of Open Universities. They in turn led to the MOOCs (massive open online courses) of the twenty-first century.9"

## Contemporary
Today, most universities teach more than research.

The connection between learning and research is to create following generations of researchers "So the Göttingen/Berlin ideal of a synthesis of research and teaching survived."

The growth of universities has also grown their toxicities, success and crisis are deeply linked.

Universities are a social asset, produced by workers and students 

Universities are mis-wielded, creating atomic weapons, excluding minority groups; women, colonised peoples, working classes, etc.

Universities are increasingly under the control of business elites

University educatˆion grants access to networks and social privilege

Seeking advantage via education undermines democratic values.


## Recognising research and teaching as work
1. we need to explore how labour organises knowledge
2. need to understand teaching and learning at advanced levels
3. must consider their workforce's cooperation and effectiveness
