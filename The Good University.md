"There is no deep purple essence of a university, able to be celebrated or betrayed. However there is a great deal of overlap in what different universities and their workers actually do; and that common ground is the subject-matter of this book."

# History of the [[purpose of university]]
Teaching and research combination is historically recent.

## Teaching the classics only
"[[John Henry Newman]]’s [[The Idea of a University]], argued that a good university should do no research at all! Its proper job was to broaden the minds of young gentlemen by exposing them to the classics."

## Professional Education
"In republican and Napoleonic France, specialized centres of professional education were created, entered only by rigorous examination. They included the famous École polytechnique and the École normale supérieure.""

## Intellectual enquiry
* Hannover and Prussia, the Universities of Göttingen and Berlin
* intellectual enquiry and  professor/student collaboration
* Universities wrestle with unknown problems, rather than repeat  knowledge

## Distance Education
#to-revisit
"In England, the University of London was set up to affiliate existing colleges through an examination system. This allowed expansion more easily than the single-campus unitary model. By the simple move of allowing outside students to sit for the exams, a mechanism for distance education was born. The University of London became the centre of an astonishing spiderweb of study centres; by the 1940s it had more than 50 overseas centres. Distance education fed into the television-and-radio work of Open Universities. They in turn led to the MOOCs (massive open online courses) of the twenty-first century.9"
